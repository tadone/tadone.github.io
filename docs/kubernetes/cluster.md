# My Clusters

## GCE Cluster
Built using: console.cloud.google.com
The cluster consist of 3 nodes (VMs) that are built using **gke-tad1-cluster-pool-micro** template. Originally the cluster was set up with

Cluster options:
- Choose Zonal: us-west1-a
- Pick your kubernetes version: 1.10.7-gke.2
- Create a 3-node pool using the cheapest instance type - f1-micro (1 vCPU, 0.6 GB memory)
- Boot disk size to 10GB, (don't enable preemptible nodes. They're cheaper but IP changes every day)
- Enable auto-upgrade and auto-repair.

Below the node pool there are some additional options.
- Disable HTTP load balancing (load balancing is expensive in GCP) and also
- Disable all the StackDriver stuff (also can be expensive and has flaky reliability in my experience) as well as - Disable the kubernetes dashboard

### GCloud CLI
```bash
brew cask install google-cloud-sdk

# GCloud
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project kubernetes-tad1

# Obtain Kubernetes config file
gcloud container clusters get-credentials tad1-cluster --zone=us-west1-a

# Create cluster role-binding
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole cluster-admin --user $(gcloud config get-value account)

# Same as above but with speciic user
kubectl create clusterrolebinding myname-cluster-admin-binding \
  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
  --user=tadone@gmail.com
```

### Traefik Load Balancer

To test out traefik.toml without valid certificate:
```bash
defaultEntryPoints = ["http", "https"]

[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.http]
  address = ":80"
    [entryPoints.http.forwardedHeaders]
      trustedIPs = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    [entryPoints.http.redirect]
      entryPoint = "https"
  [entryPoints.https]
  address = ":443"
    [entryPoints.https.tls]
    [entryPoints.https.forwardedHeaders]
      trustedIPs = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
```

::: warning
Install minikube: `brew cask install minikube`
:::

## Minkube Cluster
Minkube is used to test Kubernetes locally
```bash
# Download hyperkit driver
brew install hyperkit
sudo chown root:wheel $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit/bin/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit
sudo chmod u+s $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit/bin/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit
# Start minikube
minikube start --vm-driver hyperkit

# Deploy hello-minikube image
kubectl run hello-minikube --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.10 --port=8080
# Create a Service object that exposes the deployment:
kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort

# When the pod is running we can curl it
curl $(minikube service hello-minikube --url)

# Clean up
kubectl delete services hello-minikube
kubectl delete deployment hello-minikube
# Optionally stop minikube
minikube stop
```

### Create Service
::: warning
Use a cloud provider like Google Kubernetes Engine or Amazon Web Services to create a Kubernetes cluster. This tutorial creates an external load balancer, which requires a cloud provider.

Configure kubectl to communicate with your Kubernetes API server. For instructions, see the documentation for your cloud provider.
:::
Creating a service for an application running in five pods.

1. This command creates a Deployment object and an associated ReplicaSet object. The ReplicaSet has five Pods, each of which runs the Hello World application.
```bash
kubectl run hello-world --replicas=5 --labels="run=load-balancer-example" --image=gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0  --port=8080
```
2. Display information about the Deployment and ReplicaSets
```bash
# Deployment
kubectl get deployments hello-world
kubectl describe deployments hello-world
# ReplicaSets
kubectl get replicasets
kubectl describe replicasets
```
3. Create a Service object that exposes the deployment:
```bash
kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=LoadBalancer --name=my-service
```
4. Display information about the Service:
```bash
kubectl get services my-service
kubectl describe services my-service
```
Make a note of the external IP address (`LoadBalancer Ingress`) exposed by your service. Also note the value of `Port` and `NodePort`.
  - `Port` - internal to kubernetes
  - `NodePoert` - external to the world


5. In the `describe services my-service` output, you can see that the service has several endpoints.  These are internal addresses of the pods that are running the Hello World application. To verify these are pod addresses, enter this command:
```bash
kubectl get pods --output=wide
```
Use the external IP address (LoadBalancer Ingress) to access the Hello World application:
```bash
# Minikube (Will automatically open in browser)
minikube service my-service
# Cloud provider
curl http://<external-ip>:<port>
```
Where `<external-ip>` is the external IP address (`LoadBalancer Ingress`) of your Service, and `<port>` is the value of `Port` in your Service description. The response to a successful request is a hello message: `Hello Kubernetes!`

6. Cleaning Up
```bash
kubectl delete services my-service
kubectl delete deployment hello-world
```

### HostPath
HostPath (single node testing only â€“ local storage is not supported in any way and **WILL NOT WORK** in a multi-node cluster)
```yaml
kind: PersistentVolume
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: gitlab-data
  namespace: gitlab
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 8Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  hostPath:
    path: "/tmp/gitlab-data"
```
