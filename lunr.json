Most Common Uses of Tests 1 2 3 if [ -z  $VAR1  ]; # This will return true if a variable is unset or set to the empty string () if [ -n  $VAR1  ]; # the inverse of -z if [ ! -d  $DIR  ]; # Test if directory $DIR (does not !) exist(s)"},"code/bash.html#Loops":{"title":"Loops","path":"/code/bash.html#Loops","body":"break - Exit the currently running loop. continue - Stop this iteration of the loop and begin the next iteration.

Splitting a service into multiple processes is done for performance reasons. Process - Process is a running program. At a particular instant of time, it can be either running, sleeping, or zombie (completed process, but waiting for it&#x2019;s parent process to pick up the return value). Daemon is a subset of services that always run in memory waiting to service a request."},"linux/linux_basics.html#System":{"title":"System","path":"/linux/linux_basics.html#System","body":"Important Files/Directories 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 /usr/lib/systemd/system/ # systemd unit files /etc/systemd/system/ # Custom systemd files created by the admin /etc/yum.repos.d/name.repo # Location of Repository files (updates, software) /etc/shadow # List of users and encrypted passwords /etc/passwd # List of users with UID/GID, home dir, and default shell /etc/group # List of groups with Group ID (GID) /etc/sudoers # List of users that have sudo permissions /etc/hosts # Hosts file for IP to Host binding Process Management 1 2 3 4 5 6 ps a # show processes for all users u # display the process(s) user/owner x # also show processes not attached to a terminal # Example: ps aux | head -10 # Show top ten running processes ps aux | grep process Packages RPM 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 # INSTALL rpm -ivh rpm-file # Install new rpm package # INFO rpm -q --whatprovides ` which crond` # Find out what rpm package provides a binary rpm -q --list # -l list files in package (BINARIES) rpm -q --configfiles cronie # -c Conifg files for package rpm -q --docfiles rpm_package # -d Doc files # FIND rpm -qa | grep cronie # Query all installed packages Packages DNF Manage software on Fedora 1 dnf provides crond # Find out what package provides binary crond."},"linux/linux_basics.html#Users":{"title":"Users","path":"/linux/linux_basics.html#Users","body":"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 useradd username # Add new user named: new_user passwd username # Change password for a user id username # User Info useradd -u 999 username # Add new_user with User ID 999 -d /data/projects username # Set home for new_user to /data/projects (as opposed to /home/new_user) -u 1000 -g 500 username # Add new_user with User ID 1000 and Group ID 500 -G admins,webadmin username # Add new_user to multiple Groups -m -d /var/www/ravi -s /bin/bash -c TecMint Owner -U ravi chsh [-s login_shell] [user] # Change user shell chsh -s /bin/bash fred # Example usermod -aG group username # Add user to another group sudo visudo # Add user to sudoers ##

Using Tags In addition to markdown standard markup, Hexo uses special tags to add specific content into your pages, eg: source/lorem-ipsum.md 1 % youtube video_id % The tag youtube will include a youtube player in your page. There are many built-in tags and more can be installed. Navigation Navigation is fully customizable by updating the navigation.yaml file located in your source/_data folder. Within that file you will describe how the navigation/menu links will be presented to the user. Navigation entries are grouped by category . There are two main navigation categories : logo: used to define the values for the logo in the top navigation bar main: used to define the values showed in the left sidebar For each navigation item you must define a type and, depending on the type, other attributes such as text and/or path . Each navigation item can have a special property called children , that, as you might have guessed, gives you the ability to “nest” navigation entries. source/_data/navigation.yaml example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 logo: - text: My Documentation type : link path: index.html main: - text: PROJECTS type : label - text: My Awesome Projects type : link path: projects/my-awesome-project.html children: - text: My Awesome Projects Page 1 type : link path: projects/my-awesome-project-page-1.html There are two types of navigation items: label: navigation item as a label (it’s not an anchor so it doesn’t need a path value) link: navigation item as a link The path value for a link navigation item is just the markdown filepath , but with .html as extension.
