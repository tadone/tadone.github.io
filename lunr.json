In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 git status # Check that current branch is the receiving branch git checkout receiving-branch # If needed switch to receiving branch git pull origin # Pull latest upstream changes git merge branch-name # Merge branch-name into current branch which is receiving-branch git branch -d branch-name # Delete the branch after merging git log &amp; diff 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 git shortlog # Quick summary of commits sorted by author git log --graph --oneline --decorate # Nice graph showing commits git log --author= Bartek Gola # View commits by author git diff HEAD # Changes since last commit git diff other-branch # Difference between two branches git diff branch-name origin/branch-name # Difference between local and remote origin git diff --summary branch-name # Summary of changes since last commit against some branch Undoing changes git reset 1 2 3 4 5 git reset HEAD~1 # Un-commit changes since last commit # THIS WILL DELETE LOCAL FILES: git fetch --all # Fetch all changes first git reset --hard origin/branch_name # Reset files to the one from the branch!

Usage: git pull origin Fetch the specified remote&#x2019;s copy of the current branch and immediately merge it into the local copy. This is the same as: git fetch remote followed by git merge origin/current-branch The &#x2013;rebase option can be used to ensure a linear history by preventing unnecessary merge commits. Many developers prefer rebasing over merging, since it&#x2019;s like saying, &#x201C;I want to put my changes on top of what everybody else has done.&#x201D; git pull --rebase origin branch-name Example: The following example demonstrates how to synchronize with the central repository&#x2019;s master branch: 1 2 git checkout branch-name # Switch to a new branch git pull --rebase origin # Merge upstream changes from origin into current branch-name (using rebase) This simply moves your local changes onto the top of what everybody else has already contributed. interactive rebase Don&#x2019;t rebase public history you should never rebase commits once they&#x2019;ve been pushed to a public repository. The rebase would replace the old commits with new ones and it would look like that part of your project history abruptly vanished. 1 2 3 4 5 git checkout some-branch git rebase -i HEAD~3 # Allows sqashing commits in the last three commits in current branch git rebase -i some-branch # Interactive rebase in current branch git commit -am Big Commit # Commit changes after squashing smaller commits git push origin some-branch # Push changes upstream git push Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. Usage: git push remote branch Example: 1 2 3 git checkout branch-name # make changes to code git push origin branch-name # Push changes upstream git merge git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches.

Splitting a service into multiple processes is done for performance reasons. Process - Process is a running program. At a particular instant of time, it can be either running, sleeping, or zombie (completed process, but waiting for it’s parent process to pick up the return value). Daemon is a subset of services that always run in memory waiting to service a request.
