Usage: git push remote branch Example: 1 2 3 git checkout branch-name # make changes to code git push origin branch-name # Push changes upstream git merge git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 git status # Check that current branch is the receiving branch git checkout receiving-branch # If needed switch to receiving branch git pull origin # Pull latest upstream changes git merge branch-name # Merge branch-name into current branch which is receiving-branch git branch -d branch-name # Delete the branch after merging git log &amp; diff 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 git shortlog # Quick summary of commits sorted by author git log --graph --oneline --decorate # Nice graph showing commits git log --author= Bartek Gola # View commits by author # DIFF git diff develop master -- myfile.cs # Compare myfile.cs between develop and master git diff HEAD # Changes since last commit git diff other-branch # Difference between two branches git diff branch-name origin/branch-name # Difference between local and remote origin git diff --summary branch-name # Summary of changes since last commit against some branch git stash 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 git stash # Takes modified tracked files and staged changes and saves it... # ... on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time git stash list # To see stored stashes git stash show # Show which files have stashed changes (most recent) git stash -p # Show actual changes to the stashed files git stash apply # Apply stashed changes back to the files git stash drop # Drop the stash git stash pop # Apply stashed changes and immediately drop the stash git stash branch # Create a branch from the stashed changes/files Undoing changes git reset 1 2 3 4 5 git reset HEAD~1 # Un-commit changes since last commit # THIS WILL DELETE LOCAL FILES: git fetch --all # Fetch all changes first git reset --hard origin/branch_name # Reset files to the one from the branch!

Using Tags In addition to markdown standard markup, Hexo uses special tags to add specific content into your pages, eg: source/lorem-ipsum.md 1 % youtube video_id % The tag youtube will include a youtube player in your page. There are many built-in tags and more can be installed. Navigation Navigation is fully customizable by updating the navigation.yaml file located in your source/_data folder. Within that file you will describe how the navigation/menu links will be presented to the user. Navigation entries are grouped by category . There are two main navigation categories : logo: used to define the values for the logo in the top navigation bar main: used to define the values showed in the left sidebar For each navigation item you must define a type and, depending on the type, other attributes such as text and/or path . Each navigation item can have a special property called children , that, as you might have guessed, gives you the ability to “nest” navigation entries. source/_data/navigation.yaml example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 logo: text: My Documentation type : link path: index.html main: - text: PROJECTS type : label - text: My Awesome Projects type : link path: projects/my-awesome-project.html children: - text: My Awesome Projects Page 1 type : link path: projects/my-awesome-project-page-1.html There are two types of navigation items: label: navigation item as a label (it’s not an anchor so it doesn’t need a path value) link: navigation item as a link The path value for a link navigation item is just the markdown filepath , but with .html as extension.

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it. The list comprehension always returns a result list. The basic syntax is: [ expression for item in list if conditional ] This is equivalent to: 1 2 3 for item in list: if conditional: expression Examples 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 new_list = [x for x in range( 1 , 6 )] # = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] doubles = [x * 2 for x in range( 1 , 6 )] # = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] squares = [i ** 2 for i in range( 1 , 11 )] # Should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100] cubes_by_four = [x ** 3 for x in range( 1 , 11 ) if ((x ** 3 ) % 4 ) == 0 ] # = [8, 64, 216, 512, 1000] list1 = [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] multiplied_list = [item* 3 for item in list1] # = [9,12,15] string = \"Hello 12345 World\" numbers = [x for x in string if x.isdigit()] # list only if is digit # = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'] lower_case_list = [x.lower() for x in [ \"A\" , \"B\" , \"C\" ]] # = ['a', 'b', 'c'] More: http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python List Slicing List slicing allows us to access elements of a list in a concise manner. The syntax looks like this: [start:end:stride] Where start describes where the slice starts (inclusive), end is where it ends (exclusive), and stride describes the space between items in the sliced list.
