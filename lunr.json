https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository origin is an alias on your system for a particular remote repository. It’s not actually a property of that repository. By doing: git push origin branchname We’re pushing to origin repository, which is an alias to URL of the repository. In the push command, we can use remotes or we can simply use a URL directly. An example that uses the URL: git push git@github.com:user/branchname.git branchname Basic Operations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 git clone git://example.com/myproject # Clone existing \"myproject\" repository cd myproject git status # Shows status for tracked/modified/untracked files git checkout branch # Switch to a different branch git checkout -b branch-name # Create new branch and switch to it git branch # List local branches for repository git branch -a # List all branches for repository (including remote) git branch -d branch-name # Delete local branch git branch -D branch-name git add * or git add some_file # Add all/single file to be tracked by Git git commit -am \"Add first draft of some feature\" # Commit changes with a custom message git push origin branch-name # Push changes upstream (Github, Gitlab, BitBucket etc.) git remote -v # Display URLs referring to origin alias git remote set -url origin git@github.com:someuser/newprojectname.git # Set new URL for remote git pull Merge upstream changes into your local repository. Usage: git pull origin Fetch the specified remote’s copy of the current branch and immediately merge it into the local copy. This is the same as: git fetch remote followed by git merge origin/current-branch The –rebase option can be used to ensure a linear history by preventing unnecessary merge commits. Many developers prefer rebasing over merging, since it’s like saying, “I want to put my changes on top of what everybody else has done.” git pull --rebase origin branch-name Example: The following example demonstrates how to synchronize with the central repository’s master branch: 1 2 git checkout branch-name # Switch to a new branch git pull --rebase origin # Merge upstream changes from origin into current branch-name (using rebase) This simply moves your local changes onto the top of what everybody else has already contributed. interactive rebase Don’t rebase public history you should never rebase commits once they’ve been pushed to a public repository.

You can use it to quickly bootstrap your documentation website.

Get started Requirements To get started you need to have a couple of things installed: NodeJS Git On Linux if there is Error: watch ENOSPC Run: echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf &amp;&amp; sudo sysctl -p Installing Hexo Once all the requirements are installed, you can install Hexo with npm: 1 $ npm install -g hexo-cli Now just clone hexo-theme-doc-seed repository: 1 $ git clone https://github.com/zalando-incubator/hexo-theme-doc.git directory Go into the resulting directory and install dependencies: 1 $ npm install Start the preview server locally with: 1 hexo s If you open your browser at http://localhost:4000 you should see the documentation website up and running.

Using Tags In addition to markdown standard markup, Hexo uses special tags to add specific content into your pages, eg: source/lorem-ipsum.md 1 % youtube video_id % The tag youtube will include a youtube player in your page. There are many built-in tags and more can be installed. Navigation Navigation is fully customizable by updating the navigation.yaml file located in your source/_data folder. Within that file you will describe how the navigation/menu links will be presented to the user. Navigation entries are grouped by category . There are two main navigation categories : logo: used to define the values for the logo in the top navigation bar main: used to define the values showed in the left sidebar For each navigation item you must define a type and, depending on the type, other attributes such as text and/or path . Each navigation item can have a special property called children , that, as you might have guessed, gives you the ability to “nest” navigation entries. source/_data/navigation.yaml example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 logo: text: My Documentation type : link path: index.html main: - text: PROJECTS type : label - text: My Awesome Projects type : link path: projects/my-awesome-project.html children: - text: My Awesome Projects Page 1 type : link path: projects/my-awesome-project-page-1.html There are two types of navigation items: label: navigation item as a label (it’s not an anchor so it doesn’t need a path value) link: navigation item as a link The path value for a link navigation item is just the markdown filepath , but with .html as extension.

To avoid this use ``super`` ## Inheritance Class can inherit functions from other classes. In Python, inheritance works like this: ```python class DerivedClass (BaseClass) : # code goes here ``` where ``DerivedClass`` is the new class you &apos; re making and `` BaseClass `` is the class from which that new class inherits . ``` python class Customer (object) : # 1st Class defining Customer Produces objects that represent customers. def __init__ (self, customer_id) : self.customer_id = customer_id def display_cart (self) : print( Shopping Cart Contents ) class ReturningCustomer (Customer) : # 2nd class that inherits from Customer class For customers of the repeat variety. def display_order_history (self) : print( Order History ) monty_python = ReturningCustomer( ID: 12345 ) # Use ReturningCustomer class, which inherits from Customer class monty_python.display_cart() # display_cart method from original Customer class monty_python.display_order_history() # display_order_history method from child ReturningCustomer class"},"code/python/class.html#Super":{"title":"Super","path":"/code/python/class.html#Super","body":"In case of single inheritance, it allows us to refer base class by super() 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 class Mammal (object) : def __init__ (self, mammalName) : print(mammalName, &apos;is a warm-blooded animal.&apos; ) class Dog (Mammal) : # def __init__ (self) : print( &apos;Dog has four legs.&apos; ) super().__init__( &apos;Dog&apos; ) # Copy __init__ from Mammal class (via Dog class) # Instantiate the Dog class d1 = Dog() # OUTPUT Dog has four legs. # From Mammal class Dog is a warm-blooded animal. # From Dog class Here, we called __init__ method of the Mammal class (from the Dog class) using code. 1 2 3 super().__init__( &apos;Dog&apos; ) # instead of Mammal.__init__(self, &apos;Dog&apos; ) Since, we do not need to specify the name of the base class if we use super(), we can easily change the base class for Dog method easily (if we need to). 1 2 3 4 5 6 class Dog (CanidaeFamily) : # changing base class to CanidaeFamily def __init__ (self) : print( &apos;Dog has four legs.&apos; ) # no need to change this as it&apos;s still refering to Dog class super().__init__( &apos;Dog&apos; ) Another example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 class Person : # initializing the variables name =  age = 0 # defining constructor def __init__ (self, person_name, person_age) : self.name = person_name self.age = person_age # defining class methods def show_name (self) : print(self.name) def show_age (self) : print(self.age) # definition of subclass starts here class Student (Person) : studentId =  # Modify __init__ method using super() def __init__ (self, student_name, student_age, student_id) : # Required student_name, student_age from __init__ method of a parent Person class super().__init__(student_name, student_age) self.studentId = student_id # Add studentId def get_id (self) : return self.studentId # returns the value of student id # Create an object of the superclass person1 = Person( Richard , 23 ) # call member methods of the objects person1.show_age() # Create an object of the subclass student1 = Student( Max , 22 , 102 ) print(student1.get_id()) student1.show_name()"}}}
